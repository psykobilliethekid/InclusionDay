             <p><strong>The <span class="paragraph-white-highlight">Inclusion Project</span> was led by a dedicated group of youth leaders with disabilities from <span class="paragraph-white-highlight">Virginia’s Youth Leadership Forum</span> (<a class="about-link" href="http://www.vaboard.org" target="_blank">www.vaboard.org</a>) and <span class="paragraph-white-highlight">I’m Determined Project</span> (<a class="about-link" href="http://www.imdetermined.org" target="_blank">www.imdetermined.org</a>) who were concerned about what they perceived as a lack of general awareness of disabilities in schools by peers, educators and staff.  These youth successfully pushed for a <span class="paragraph-white-highlight">Disability History and Awareness Month (DHAM)</span> which was introduced and passed in February 2009 by the <span class="paragraph-white-highlight">Virginia General Assembly</span>. In Virginia, <span class="paragraph-white-highlight">DHAM</span> is officially celebrated in <span class="paragraph-white-highlight">Virginia Public Schools and Institutions of Higher Education</span> across the Commonwealth during the month of October.</strong></p>

             <p><strong>The same group of youth leaders with disabilities approached the <span class="paragraph-white-highlight">Virginia Department of Education (VDOE)</span> in 2012, and asked <span class="paragraph-white-highlight">“what could be done in the Commonwealths K-12 schools to increase awareness of individuals with disabilities year round to call attention to their capacity to make significant contributions?”</span> The group of youth was asked by <span class="paragraph-white-highlight">VDOE</span> to develop a proposal with their own ideas. <span class="paragraph-white-highlight">The result was the Inclusion Project.</span> The youth leadership team felt strongly that an activity-based approach with students directly involved in hands-on activities would increase awareness and education in schools, and would be an integral part of Virginia’s celebration of DHAM.</strong></p>
