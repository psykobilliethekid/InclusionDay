                                Elementary School: Day-in-the-Life Activity People Needed to Organize: One-Two (Physical Education Teacher, Teaching Assistants) People Needed to Carry Out: At least six (6) students, volunteers Recommended Setting(s): Gymnasium, outdoors, hallway Materials
                                Needed: Manual wheelchairs, guide canes, obstacles (e.g., cones, chairs, ladder, studentâ€™s legs, stairs) Time Needed: 60 minutes Goal: To experience what a person with a physical or sensory disability goes through on a
                                daily basis while moving around in school. Teacher Preparation: 1) Survey the school to find ways that the school itself can be used to demonstrate obstacles for someone in a wheelchair. 2) Set up obstacles for the students
                                to navigate around while blindfolded or using a wheelchair. (Examples: moving through student filled hallways, finding an accessible entrance, picking up things off of the ground or reaching objects that are up high.) 3)
                                Set up a specific route through/around the school or classroom that includes various obstacles, have a specific goal in mind such as retrieving a book from the library or getting their lunch in the cafeteria. 4) Schedule
                                the activity, secure equipment, and plan logistics. Step By Step Description: 1) Explain the activity to the students and demonstrate how to use a guide cane and wheelchair. 2) Have students maneuver a wheelchair or use
                                a guide cane to navigate through the obstacles set up around the classroom or school. The other students should either watch or participate by becoming an obstacle (for example: a crowded hallway). 3) After the activity
                                bring the students back together and have them discuss what they experienced and what they learned from the activity. Reflection Questions: 1) What are two words that describe how you felt during the activity? Go around
                                the room and have each student share his/her two words. 2) What did you think about while trying to move around in the wheelchair? 3) Was it easy to get around the obstacles while blindfolded and using a guide cane? 4)
                                Did it take longer to complete activities while you were in a wheelchair or blindfolded? Authors: Elementary Work Group

                                Equipment Time Needed: 60 minutes Goal: Students will understand how people with disabilities use technology in their daily lives. Teacher Preparation: 1) Review the following videos about people with disabilities using
                                technology: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcUNnnwFm4g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhj5vs9P5cw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNV2n8hqF_c https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYmfrrY4Hfk 2) Select videos or clips to share
                                with students. Step By Step Description: 1) Show videos or clips about the use of various types of assistive-technology. 2) Discuss how technology can assist people with disabilities. Incorporate a lesson about technology
                                and how it is used in daily life (i.e., iPad, computer, wheelchair). 3) Ask students how technology has changed the way that people with disabilities participate in society. Reflection Questions: 1) What do you think about
                                how people with disabilities use technology to communicate? 2) How would you play with someone who has a disability? 3) Do you think it is cool that people with disabilities can use technology to participate in different
                                activities? Authors: Elementary Work Group

                                Elementary School: Famous Musicians with Disabilities People Needed to Organize: One-Two (Music Teacher, Social Studies Teacher) People Needed to Carry Out: At least six (6) students Recommended Setting(s): Classroom Materials Needed: AV Equipment, internet
                                access, CDs, musical instruments, blind folds, cotton balls or ear plugs Time Needed: 60 minutes Goal: Students will learn about different musicians who have disabilities. Teacher Preparation: 1) Review video of George
                                Dennehy: http://youtu.be/NvsTspJlGIc 2) Review video of Stevie Wonder: http://youtu.be/8r92A7ndnZk 3) Review video of Rick Allen, drummer for Def Leppard: http://youtu.be/bMyOab17LhA 4) Select some recordings of Beethoven,
                                Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Rick Allen, and/or George Dennehy to play for the students. 5) If you are using ear plugs instead of cotton balls, make sure that it is safe to put ear plugs in studentsâ€™ ears. Be aware of any
                                unforeseen issues about tying the studentâ€™s arms. Remember that it is the studentâ€™s choice to simulate an impairment. Step By Step Description: 1) Play the music by musicians with disabilities for students. 2) Select a
                                video or clip to share with students. 3) Explain that the selected musicians have disabilities. 4) Give the students musical instruments and play as a class a commonly known song (i.e., Pop Goes the Weasel, Baa Baa Black
                                Sheep, The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round). Record the class playing the song. 5) Have each student choose an impairment they would like to simulate (i.e., Tying their arm behind their back, blindfold, put cotton
                                in their ears). 6) Play the song again and record. 7) Play both recordings and have class discussion by using the reflection questions. Reflection Questions: 1) What do you think about the musicians with disabilities? 2)
                                What do you think of the two recordings? 3) What was the difference in playing the instrument while having your (arm tied behind your back or blindfolded, or cotton in your ears)? (Emphasize that these musicians have practiced)

                                    Elementary School: Day-in-the-Life Activity People Needed to Organize: One-Two (Physical Education Teacher, Teaching Assistants) People Needed to Carry Out: At least six (6) students, volunteers Recommended Setting(s): Gymnasium, outdoors, hallway Materials
                                    Needed: Manual wheelchairs, guide canes, obstacles (e.g., cones, chairs, ladder, studentâ€™s legs, stairs) Time Needed: 60 minutes Goal: To experience what a person with a physical or sensory disability goes through on
                                    a daily basis while moving around in school. Teacher Preparation: 1) Survey the school to find ways that the school itself can be used to demonstrate obstacles for someone in a wheelchair. 2) Set up obstacles for the
                                    students to navigate around while blindfolded or using a wheelchair. (Examples: moving through student filled hallways, finding an accessible entrance, picking up things off of the ground or reaching objects that are
                                    up high.) 3) Set up a specific route through/around the school or classroom that includes various obstacles, have a specific goal in mind such as retrieving a book from the library or getting their lunch in the cafeteria.
                                    4) Schedule the activity, secure equipment, and plan logistics. Step By Step Description: 1) Explain the activity to the students and demonstrate how to use a guide cane and wheelchair. 2) Have students maneuver a wheelchair
                                    or use a guide cane to navigate through the obstacles set up around the classroom or school. The other students should either watch or participate by becoming an obstacle (for example: a crowded hallway). 3) After the
                                    activity bring the students back together and have them discuss what they experienced and what they learned from the activity. Reflection Questions: 1) What are two words that describe how you felt during the activity?
                                    Go around the room and have each student share his/her two words. 2) What did you think about while trying to move around in the wheelchair? 3) Was it easy to get around the obstacles while blindfolded and using a guide
                                    cane? 4) Did it take longer to complete activities while you were in a wheelchair or blindfolded? Authors: Elementary Work Group

                                    Dennehy: http://youtu.be/NvsTspJlGIc 2) Review video of Stevie Wonder: http://youtu.be/8r92A7ndnZk 3) Review video of Rick Allen, drummer for Def Leppard: http://youtu.be/bMyOab17LhA 4) Select some recordings of Beethoven,
                                    Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Rick Allen, and/or George Dennehy to play for the students. 5) If you are using ear plugs instead of cotton balls, make sure that it is safe to put ear plugs in studentsâ€™ ears. Be aware of
                                    any unforeseen issues about tying the studentâ€™s arms. Remember that it is the studentâ€™s choice to simulate an impairment. Step By Step Description: 1) Play the music by musicians with disabilities for students. 2) Select
                                    a video or clip to share with students. 3) Explain that the selected musicians have disabilities. 4) Give the students musical instruments and play as a class a commonly known song (i.e., Pop Goes the Weasel, Baa Baa
                                    Black Sheep, The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round). Record the class playing the song. 5) Have each student choose an impairment they would like to simulate (i.e., Tying their arm behind their back, blindfold, put
                                    cotton in their ears). 6) Play the song again and record. 7) Play both recordings and have class discussion by using the reflection questions. Reflection Questions: 1) What do you think about the musicians with disabilities?
                                    2) What do you think of the two recordings? 3) What was the difference in playing the instrument while having your (arm tied behind your back or blindfolded, or cotton in your ears)? (Emphasize that these musicians

                                        Needed: Manual wheelchairs, guide canes, obstacles (e.g., cones, chairs, ladder, studentâ€™s legs, stairs) Time Needed: 60 minutes Goal: To experience what a person with a physical or sensory disability goes through
                                        on a daily basis while moving around in school. Teacher Preparation: 1) Survey the school to find ways that the school itself can be used to demonstrate obstacles for someone in a wheelchair. 2) Set up obstacles
                                        for the students to navigate around while blindfolded or using a wheelchair. (Examples: moving through student filled hallways, finding an accessible entrance, picking up things off of the ground or reaching objects
                                        that are up high.) 3) Set up a specific route through/around the school or classroom that includes various obstacles, have a specific goal in mind such as retrieving a book from the library or getting their lunch
                                        in the cafeteria. 4) Schedule the activity, secure equipment, and plan logistics. Step By Step Description: 1) Explain the activity to the students and demonstrate how to use a guide cane and wheelchair. 2) Have
                                        students maneuver a wheelchair or use a guide cane to navigate through the obstacles set up around the classroom or school. The other students should either watch or participate by becoming an obstacle (for example:
                                        a crowded hallway). 3) After the activity bring the students back together and have them discuss what they experienced and what they learned from the activity. Reflection Questions: 1) What are two words that describe
                                        how you felt during the activity? Go around the room and have each student share his/her two words. 2) What did you think about while trying to move around in the wheelchair? 3) Was it easy to get around the obstacles
                                        while blindfolded and using a guide cane? 4) Did it take longer to complete activities while you were in a wheelchair or blindfolded? Authors: Elementary Work Group

                                        access, CDs, musical instruments, blind folds, cotton balls or ear plugs Time Needed: 60 minutes Goal: Students will learn about different musicians who have disabilities. Teacher Preparation: 1) Review video of
                                        George Dennehy: http://youtu.be/NvsTspJlGIc 2) Review video of Stevie Wonder: http://youtu.be/8r92A7ndnZk 3) Review video of Rick Allen, drummer for Def Leppard: http://youtu.be/bMyOab17LhA 4) Select some recordings
                                        of Beethoven, Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Rick Allen, and/or George Dennehy to play for the students. 5) If you are using ear plugs instead of cotton balls, make sure that it is safe to put ear plugs in studentsâ€™
                                        ears. Be aware of any unforeseen issues about tying the studentâ€™s arms. Remember that it is the studentâ€™s choice to simulate an impairment. Step By Step Description: 1) Play the music by musicians with disabilities
                                        for students. 2) Select a video or clip to share with students. 3) Explain that the selected musicians have disabilities. 4) Give the students musical instruments and play as a class a commonly known song (i.e.,
                                        Pop Goes the Weasel, Baa Baa Black Sheep, The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round). Record the class playing the song. 5) Have each student choose an impairment they would like to simulate (i.e., Tying their arm
                                        behind their back, blindfold, put cotton in their ears). 6) Play the song again and record. 7) Play both recordings and have class discussion by using the reflection questions. Reflection Questions: 1) What do you
                                        think about the musicians with disabilities? 2) What do you think of the two recordings? 3) What was the difference in playing the instrument while having your (arm tied behind your back or blindfolded, or cotton
                                        in your ears)? (Emphasize that these musicians have practiced) Authors: Elementary School Work Group

                                        Students will learn about different simple machines and how the simple machines could work to assist people with disabilities. Teacher Preparation: 1) Review simple machines by visiting the following site: https://ees-ecsd-fl.schoolloop.com/simplemachines
                                        or by using your teaching resources. 2) Review the following site for information about disability technology and devices: http://www.disabled-world.com/assistivedevices/ 3) Gather simple machines for the students
                                        to have hands on exploration. Step By Step Description: 1) Review the types of simple machines with the students. Explain that two simple machines make up a complex machine. 2) Show the students several assistive
                                        technology and devices (i.e., wheelchairs, ramps, canes). 3) Divide students into groups of three-four and have them work with simple machines to see how they work. 4) Bring students back into large group to create
                                        a list of how simple machines that can help people with disabilities. Reflection Questions: 1) What simple machine did your group choose? 2) How could this simple machine help those with disabilities? Authors: Elementary
